# 3. Maybe and List

## Sources

- [Documentation Maybe](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Maybe)
- [Documentation List](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/List)
- [Documentation String](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/String)

## DIY

In this chapter your goal is to implement 2 functions that require you to work with `Maybe` and `List`.
These are located in the `src/Chapter3.elm`. The tests are located in `tests/Chapter3Test.elm`.
By removing `skip <|` one by one, you can enable each test.

You may need one or more of the following functions (you can find the documentation in the above sources):

```
String.toInt
String.toFloat
Maybe.map
Maybe.map2
Maybe.withDefault
List.take
List.filter
List.reverse
modBy
toFloat
```

## What you should know afterwards

- Why `Maybe` works as it does;
- Why `List` works as it does;
- How `map` and `andThen` work and when to apply them.
