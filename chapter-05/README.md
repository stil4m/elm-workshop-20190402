## DIY

In this chapter we're going to make a start with the `Memory` game.
We will try to render multiple cards (2 in this chapter) in a state of open or closed.
The user should be able to open/close the cards with a mouse click (`onClick`).

You can start up `elm reactor` and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/src/Memory.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/Memory.elm), to see your starting point.
The `src/Memory.elm` file contains 6 `TODO`s which you need to resolve to get the program working.

Hints:

- `not` will invert a boolean (`Bool`) value.

## What you should know afterwards

- Understand how the Elm architecture works;
- Be able to make changes in programs structured in the Elm architecture.
